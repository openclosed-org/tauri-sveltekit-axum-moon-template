# Production-Ready Claims Without Evidence

## Decision

Do not describe this repository, the counter reference chain, GitOps path, worker path, or service template as production-ready without matching operational evidence.

## Why This Is Out Of Scope

The repository is production-minded, not production-proven by claim. It intentionally keeps a small backend-core path while leaving room for topology, infrastructure, and delivery growth.

Calling a path production-ready before its durability, recovery, deployment, rollback, security, and operational evidence exist causes adopters and agents to over-trust the template.

## Reconsideration Criteria

A stronger readiness claim needs path-scoped evidence such as:

1. documented runtime profile
2. verified secret and deployable path
3. rollback and drift handling evidence
4. worker retry, checkpoint, dedupe, replay, and recovery evidence at the claimed scale
5. security and operational runbook evidence
6. release gates that exercise the claim
