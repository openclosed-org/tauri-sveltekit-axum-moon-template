# Skill Authoring

Repository skills should be small, triggerable, and composable.

## Skill Types

**Ownership skills** define writable paths and responsibility boundaries, such as `service-agent` or `worker-agent`.

**Workflow skills** define how to perform an engineering activity, such as diagnosis, TDD, grilling, or architecture review.

Workflow skills guide process. Ownership skills still decide writable boundaries.

## Required Shape

Every `SKILL.md` must have frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  Short capability summary. Use when specific triggers, file paths, or task types apply.
---
```

The description is the trigger interface. It must state what the skill does and when to use it.

## Writing Rules

1. Keep `SKILL.md` short enough to load frequently.
2. Move detailed references into adjacent `REFERENCE.md`, `LANGUAGE.md`, or `scripts/**` files.
3. Do not duplicate `AGENTS.md`, `north-star.md`, or ADR doctrine.
4. Do not describe target state as current behavior.
5. Do not create a new source of truth for runtime behavior.
6. Link references one level deep when possible.
7. Add scripts only for deterministic operations, validation, formatting, or repeatable evidence capture.

## Review Checklist

1. Description includes `Use when` triggers.
2. The skill has one clear responsibility.
3. Writable and forbidden paths are clear for ownership skills.
4. Workflow skills defer to ownership boundaries.
5. Evidence language uses `declared`, `checked`, `tested`, and `proven` precisely.
6. No time-sensitive claims or stale file maps are embedded.
